# Hi there, I'm darcylillian273 👋  

I'm a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. My expertise spans across multiple programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
Here’s a glimpse of the technologies I work with:  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, SASS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Postman, Jira  

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning  
I’m diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and exploring **serverless architectures** with AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. I’m also experimenting with **WebAssembly (WASM)** to build high-performance web applications.  

## 💡 My Approach to Development  
- **Clean Code**: I prioritize readability, maintainability, and scalability in every project.  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests first ensures robust and reliable code.  
- **Agile Methodology**: I thrive in iterative development cycles and value continuous feedback.  
- **Open Source**: I believe in giving back to the community and actively contribute to open-source projects.
